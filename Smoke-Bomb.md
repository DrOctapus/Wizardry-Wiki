## Description
_Launches a smoke bomb in the direction you are pointing which explodes on impact, releasing smoke and blinding nearby creatures for a short time._

Smoke bomb is a ranged AoE spell which, whilst it does not deal any damage, gives players a blindness effect and prevents mobs from targeting anything. It is one of several 'bomb' spells, all of which operate in a similar fashion.

## Trivia
- Smoke bombs are also available as a [[throwable item|Smoke-Bomb]].
