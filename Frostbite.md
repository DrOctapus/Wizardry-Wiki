## Description
Frostbite is a negative potion effect which causes both slowed movement and mining fatigue. Frostbite I reduces a player or mob to half of its normal speed and makes breaking blocks 45% slower. Frostbite II roots the player or mob to the spot and makes breaking blocks 90% slower. Frostbite does not deal any damage and cannot directly kill a player or mob.

## Sources
Most ice [[spells]] inflict frostbite on their targets. In addition, being hit with a [[frost axe]] or a [[freezing weapon]] also gives the frostbite effect.

## Trivia
- When under the effects of frostbite II, players and mobs are unable to move by walking but may move slowly by jumping.
- Amplifiers higher than frostbite II can only be obtained using commands.
