Special wand upgrades are items that improve particular aspects of [[wands]]. There are currently eight types of special wand upgrades: storage, siphon, condenser, range, duration, cooldown, blast and attunement.

## Obtaining
Special wand upgrades can be found in loot chests in dungeons and [[wizard towers|Wizard-Tower]] or purchased from [[wizards|Wizard]]. They are also available in the wizardry tab of the creative mode inventory or via the /give command.

## Usage
Special wand upgrades can be applied to wands using an [[arcane workbench]]. To do this, the wand is placed in the central slot and the upgrade is placed in the lower of the two slots on the left. Pressing the 'apply' button applies the upgrade to the wand, consuming it in the process. Up to 3 upgrades of a single type may be added to a wand, and the total number of special upgrades that may be applied to a wand depends on its tier - 3 for novice wands, 4 for apprentice wands, 5 for advanced wands and 6 for master wands.

Wand upgrades stack, so the more upgrades of a single type a wand has, the greater the effect will be. For example, a single storage upgrade will increase the amount of mana a wand can hold by 15%, two will increase it by 30%, and a maximum 3 storage upgrades will increase the mana capacity by 45%.

## Types of Upgrade

### Storage Upgrade
Storage upgrades increase the mana capacity of wands. Each storage upgrade increases the amount of mana a wand can hold by 15%. This means, for example, that a single storage upgrade applied to a novice wand will increase its mana capacity from 700 to 805. A master wand with a maximum of 3 storage upgrades applied will have a mana capacity of 3625.

### Siphon Upgrade
Siphon upgrades cause wands to extract mana from creatures their wielder kills. When a player kills any creature, the first wand on their hotbar* which has a siphon upgrade will gain a small amount of mana. The kill can be with anything, it does not have to be the wand with the upgrade - any kill that counts as a player kill will grant siphon mana. The mana gained is a random number from 3-5 per siphon upgrade. This means that a wand with 1 siphon upgrade will gain 3-5 mana per kill, a wand with 2 siphon upgrades will gain 6-10 mana and a wand with 3 siphon upgrades will gain 9-15 mana. Only the first wand on the player's hotbar* gains mana for a kill, even if there are other wands with siphon upgrades on the player's hotbar.

_* The exact order is main hand, then offhand, followed by the rest of the hotbar left-to-right._

### Condenser Upgrade
Condenser upgrades cause wands to slowly regenerate mana over time. When a wand with a condenser upgrade is in a player's inventory or in an arcane workbench, it will gain 1 mana per condenser upgrade every 1.5 seconds. Unlike siphon upgrades, _all_ wands with condenser upgrades will gain mana simultaneously, even if a player is carrying more than one.

### Range Upgrade
Range upgrades increase the range of spells cast by a wand. Projectiles will fly further and faster, constructs can be created from further away, and ray-type spells will have a longer reach. Each range upgrade increases a wand's range by 25%, so a maximum 3 range upgrades will give a 75% range increase. A few spells such as [[phase step]] have special behaviours with range upgrades; see individual spells' pages for details.

### Duration Upgrade
Duration upgrades increase the length of time spells cast by a wand last for. Summoned creatures will last for longer before vanishing, potion effects will last for longer, and conjured items and constructs will last for longer. Each duration upgrade increases the duration of spells by 25%, so a maximum 3 duration upgrades will give a 75% duration increase.

### Cooldown Upgrade
Cooldown upgrades reduce the length of all spell cooldowns for a wand. Each cooldown upgrade reduces the cooldown time of spells by 15%, so a maximum 3 cooldown upgrades will decrease the cooldown time by 45%. This effect also stacks with the [[font of mana]] spell.

### Blast Upgrade
Blast upgrades increase the blast radius or area of effect of spells cast by a wand. Explosions will be bigger and spells with an area of effect will affect a larger area. Each blast upgrade will increase the radius of the area of effect by 25%, so a maximum 3 blast upgrades will give a 75% blast radius increase.

### Attunement Upgrade
Attunement upgrades increase the number of spells that can be bound to a wand. Each attunement upgrade grants one additional spell slot, so a maximum 3 attunement upgrades will increase the number of spells a wand can hold from 5 to 8.
