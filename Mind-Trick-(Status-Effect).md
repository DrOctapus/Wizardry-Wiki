## Description
Mind trick is a negative status effect which prevents mobs from targeting. A mob with the mind trick effect will not attempt to pursue or attack any players or mobs and will lose any target it had when it was inflicted with the mind trick effect.

## Sources
The mind trick spell inflicts mind trick I on its target for 15 seconds. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- The amplifier has no effect for mind trick, much like blindness or nausea in vanilla _Minecraft_.
- Mind trick has no effect on players or passive mobs.
