_\* The [[magic missile]] spell book is craftable._

Spell books are one of the two forms in which [[spells]] are recorded, the other being [[scrolls]]. Unlike scrolls, spell books are permanent, and are used to bind the spells they contain to [[wands]]. Spell books also contain information about spells.

## Obtaining
Spell books can be obtained in a number of ways: they can be found in loot chests in dungeons and wizard towers, purchased from [[wizards]], dropped by [[evil wizards]] when killed, and all mobs have a small chance to drop a spell book when killed by a player. The magic missile spell book can also be crafted from a book and four [[magic crystals]].

## Usage
Spell books are used to bind the spell they contain to wands or blank scrolls in the [[arcane workbench|Arcane-Workbench]]; see that page for more details. Pressing the use item button whilst holding a spell book will display a GUI allowing the player to read it. Spell books contain the name, [[spell type|Spell Types]], [[tier|Tiers]], [[element|Elements]], and mana cost of the spell, as well as a short description and a pictorial representation of the spell. If the spell has not yet been discovered, the text in the spell book (with the exception of the spell's tier) will be written in random glyphs much like in the enchanting table, and the spell picture will be blank.
