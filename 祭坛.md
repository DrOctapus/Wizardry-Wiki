> 由于祭坛具有强大的奥术能量与巫术界的重要性，更别提其中价值连城的稀奇宝物对巫师们的吸引力了——当然，祭坛也是很危险的。传说有很多巫师被囚禁在了祭坛里面，他们疯了？也许是因为封闭恐惧症吧。不过有的人认为，这是祭坛故意而为之的，这些被囚禁的巫师可能也是祭坛自卫系统的一部分。当你刚刚走进祭坛，就有许多发了疯的大汉出现在你身边，哦天哪，想想这场景就让我毛骨悚然！

祭坛是在主世界地表随机生成的多方块结构，当然你也可以修改 [[祭坛维度|Configuration#祭坛维度]]配置文件来让它在其他维度生成。符文的构成是一圈高低不一的 [[符文石]]柱子围绕着一块 [[符文石基座]] 。有一个被施加奥术锁魔法的箱子位于符文石基座之上。

## 总览
默认情况下祭坛是只会在主世界的地表生成的，不过你可以修改配置文件来实现在下界/末地探索祭坛的想法。默认设置使祭坛在世界中十分罕见，远远比[[巫师塔|巫师塔]] 少的多，不过这也可以在配置文件中修改。祭坛是可以在所有生物群系生成的，除了箱子和符文石基座，祭坛的其他地方都是由 [[符文石]] 建造的。 祭坛有着八种不同的元素样式，它们的符文石柱都是不同方块——不过中间有一个箱子这一点是可以确保一样的。

每个祭坛都会有一种[[元素]]，看符文石柱的颜色你就知道了！祭坛的元素属性还决定了生成的巫师的元素属性。一个祭坛不会生成另一种元素属性的巫师。

The loot chest found in a shrine is guaranteed to always contain one [[artefact|artefacts]], with higher-tier artefacts being rarer. Artefacts are found nowhere else. Alongside this, the chest can contain a variety of magical items, including magic crystals and elemental crystals, spell books and scrolls, and wand and armour upgrades, as well as other loot such as books, paper and emeralds.

## Mechanics
When initially generated, shrines are unactivated, and the chest in the centre is arcane-locked with no owner, preventing it from being opened or destroyed in survival mode. The shrine is activated when a player moves within 5 blocks of the central pedestal (which roughly corresponds to within the ring of pillars), signified by a sound and red particle effect. This immediately causes 3 [[evil wizards|Evil-Wizard]] to spawn which match the shrine's element, and a [[containment|Containment (Status Effect)]] effect to be applied to all players, wizards and evil wizards within 15 blocks of the central pedestal. This effect is refreshed every second as long as the shrine is active, much like that from a beacon, preventing the player and the spawned wizards from escaping.

Once a shrine is active, it may only be deactivated by killing all three evil wizards that were spawned. Upon doing so, a second sound and particle effect signify that the shrine has been conquered, and the arcane lock on the chest is removed, allowing the player to access the loot inside. Once conquered, the containment effect no longer refreshes, and will wear off after 10 seconds, allowing any players inside to escape.

In creative mode, the shrine can also be deactivated by breaking the central runestone pedestal block. This block is unbreakable in survival.

## Trivia
- When fast worldgen is enabled, shrines can sometimes generate in lakes, resulting in them being partially or even fully submerged.
