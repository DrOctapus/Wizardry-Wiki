# Wizardry Wiki
Repository-based mirror for the wizardry wiki, provided so the community can contribute to the wiki via fork &amp; PR

To contribute to the wiki, simply fork this repository and edit the pages and images, on GitHub (no downloading necessary, yay!) or using your markdown editor of choice. When you're done, submit a PR and I'll review it, merge changes, and push them to the live copy of the wiki.
