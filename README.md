## Style Guide

Please follow these guidelines when adding and editing wiki content, it'll help your contribution fit seamlessly into the wiki!

- Wiki pages should be written in an informational style, and not include opinion or other bias. Unlike the in-game documentation, the wiki is no place for fancy, mysterious language! The aim is to convey information in an easy-to-understand format.

- Screenshots are good! Please preferably use the default resource pack (or the new Jappa textures) without shaders, and try to keep them 'clean' i.e. free of inventory clutter, other mods' machinery and items, photobombing mobs...

- When applicable, match existing pages' formatting and headings. For example, a new spell page should have the same format as all the other spell pages. A good way to do this is by copying an existing page and then editing the information.

- You can add captions to your images directly below them, _in italics_.

- You can quote text from the mod as part of a page, use blockquotes (`>` at the start of the paragraph) to emphasise the quote. These can have captions to show where they are from.
