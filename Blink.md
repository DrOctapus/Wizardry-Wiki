## Description
_将施法者向指针方向传送一小段距离，类似末影人的传送。_

Blink provides a fairly low-cost, low-cooldown short-range teleport, similar to that used by endermen.

## Trivia
- Wizards with the blink spell will use it during combat to teleport to a random location within a certain radius of their opponent, often behind them.
