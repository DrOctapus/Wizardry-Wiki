## Description
Arcane jammer is a negative potion effect which prevents players and mobs from using magic. A player or mob under the arcane jammer effect will not be able to cast [[spells]] through any means, whether using a wand, a scroll or commands. Players will also see the spell name greyed out in the spell HUD.

## Sources
The arcane jammer spell inflicts arcane jammer I on its target for 15 seconds without modifiers. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- The amplifier has no effect for arcane jammer, much like blindness or nausea in vanilla _Minecraft_.
- Since various summoned creatures use spells as attacks, these summoned creatures will not be able to attack while under the arcane jammer effect.
