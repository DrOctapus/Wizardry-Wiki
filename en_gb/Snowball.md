## Description
_Launches a snowball in the direction you are pointing._

Snowball is a very simple spell which launches a snowball as if the caster had thrown it.

## Trivia
- Costing just 1 mana, snowball is the cheapest spell in wizardry.
- Just like thrown snowballs, the snowball spell will deal damage to blazes.
- Because it only costs 1 mana, using snowball on any ice wand costs no mana at all! This is not as overpowered as it seems, though - free snowballs can be obtained very easily in vanilla _Minecraft_ from snow golems.
