Scrolls of identification are single-use items that allow the player to discover an undiscovered item on their hotbar. Currently, they may only be found in loot chests or purchased from [[wizards|Wizard]].

## Obtaining
Scrolls of identification can be found in loot chests in dungeons and [[wizard towers|Wizard-Tower]]. Wizards sometimes offer scrolls of identification for purchase, and for the purposes of weighting and pricing they are treated as apprentice tier. They are also available in the wizardry tab of the creative mode inventory and via the /give command.

## Usage
Pressing the use item button whilst holding a scroll of identification will identify the first [[spell book]] or [[scroll|Scrolls]] on the player's hotbar*. A chat message will be displayed to the player (but nobody else) that the spell contained within the spell book or scroll has been discovered, or, if no unidentified item was found, the message: "Nothing to identify!".

_* The exact order of precedence is main hand, then offhand, followed by the rest of the hotbar left-to-right._
