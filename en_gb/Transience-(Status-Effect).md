## Description
Transience is a beneficial status effect which causes players and mobs to become invulnerable to all blockable damage. However, the player or mob will not be able to cause any damage while the effect is active, nor will they be able to break or place blocks. Transience is useful when trying to escape a dangerous situation, as it effectively turns the player into a 'ghost' that cannot interact with the world but is immune to all damage. Players and mobs under the transience effect also emit a subtle dust particle effect. Players with transience also see a bright yellowish 'nova' effect over their screen if they have custom shaders enabled.

## Sources
The transience spell grants the caster transience I (and also invisibility) for 20 seconds without modifiers. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- The amplifier has no effect for transience, much like fire resistance or water breathing in vanilla _Minecraft_.
