## Description
Static aura is a beneficial status effect which causes players and mobs to fire sparks of lightning at attackers. A player or mob with the static aura effect causes a spark of lightning to be fired at any creature that melee attacks it, dealing 2 hearts of damage.

## Sources
The static aura spell grants the caster static aura I for 30 seconds. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- The amplifier has no effect for static aura, much like fire resistance or water breathing in vanilla _Minecraft_.
