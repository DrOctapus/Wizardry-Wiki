## Description
Font of mana is a beneficial status effect which dramatically reduces a player's [[spell|Spells]] cooldowns. Font of mana I reduces spell cooldowns to 1/2 of their normal duration, font of mana II reduces them to 1/3 of their normal duration, and so on (though amplifiers greater than II can only be attained via commands).

## Sources
The font of mana spell grants the caster font of mana I, or, when used on a master healing [[wand|Wands]], font of mana II. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- The font of mana effect stacks with [[wand cooldown upgrades|Special-Wand-Upgrades#cooldown-upgrade]].
