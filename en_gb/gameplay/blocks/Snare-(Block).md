Snare blocks are traps placed by the [[snare]] spell. When stepped upon by a mob or player, the snare breaks, damaging the mob or player and inflicting them with a weakness effect.

## Obtaining
Snares can be placed using the snare spell. Aiming the spell at the top of a block will place a snare at that location. Snares can only be obtained as an inventory item using the `/give` command.

## Mechanics
A mob or player that steps on the snare block will trigger the trap, receiving 3 hearts of damage and weakness III for 5 seconds. The snare block is immediately destroyed when triggered.

When placed by a spell, a snare block stores the caster of that spell as its owner (if any). The owner and their allies will not trigger the trap when stepping on the snare block.
