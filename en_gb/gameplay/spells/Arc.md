Arc is the most basic of all the lightning spells, providing a close-ranged attack that deals 2.5 hearts of damage.

## Trivia
- As with most lightning spells, hitting a creeper with the arc spell will cause it to become charged.
- [[Lightning wraiths|Lightning-Wraith]] use the arc spell as an attack.
