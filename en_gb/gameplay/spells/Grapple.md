## Description
_Shoots a magical vine which allows the caster to grapple towards blocks or reel in entities. Release the use item button to let go of the block or entity._

Grapple is a useful apprentice-tier utility spell. Its primary use is grappling towards blocks: when aimed at a block within range, a vine shoots out towards that block and attaches to it, after which the player is moved quickly towards it as long as they continue to cast the spell.

The grapple spell also has a secondary use, which is to reel in players and mobs, similarly to a fishing rod. When cast at a player or mob, the vine attaches to it and pulls it towards the spell caster, instead of the spell caster moving.
