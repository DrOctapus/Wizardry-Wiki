Smoke bombs are throwable items that cause a small blast of blinding smoke on impact. They may be found in loot chests or crafted.

## Obtaining
Smoke bombs may be found in loot chests in dungeons. They may also be crafted from a glass bottle, gunpowder and coal.

_The crafting recipe for smoke bombs_

## Usage
Right-clicking whilst holding a smoke bomb will throw it in the direction the player is looking, much like a snowball or ender pearl. When the smoke bomb hits a block or creature, it will explode, blinding all mobs within a 3 block radius.

## Trivia
Since blindness doesn't affect non-players in vanilla _Minecraft_, smoke bombs actually inflict the [[mind trick|Mind-Trick-(Status-Effect)]] effect on non-player creatures instead. This has the effect of disabling their targeting, as if they are unable to see.
