Stones of transportation are special blocks whose sole purpose is to be used with the [[transportation]] spell.

## Appearance
Stones of transportation are small cube-shaped blocks, with a greenish maze-like texture. They occupy the bottom of the full block space when placed.

## Obtaining
Stones of transportation can be crafted from one magic crystal of any element (including non-elemental crystals) surrounded by 4 stone blocks. This recipe yields 2 stones of transportation.

## Usage
The sole use for stones of transportation is as markers for the transportation spell. In order to use the spell, eight stones of transportation must be arranged in a ring formation as shown below. Any one of the stones may then be right-clicked with a wand to set the centre of the stone circle as the destination for the transportation spell (the wand need not have the transportation spell equipped).

_The ring formation required for a valid stone circle_

Right-clicking a stone of transportation that is not part of a valid stone circle will display a visual effect where there are stones missing to help the player build the correct shape.
