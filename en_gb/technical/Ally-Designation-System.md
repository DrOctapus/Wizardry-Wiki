_Since: Wizardry 1.1_

The ally designation system (ADS) provides a way of controlling the targets of your spells, allowing you to fight alongside your friends more effectively.

To designate a player as your ally, **sneak-right-click on them whilst holding any wand**. A chat message should appear confirming that the player is now your ally. Repeat this process to remove a player from your allies. Note that **you are not automatically made an ally of the player in question**; one player can be in another player's allies without that player being in theirs, and vice versa.

Designating a player as an ally has the following effects:

* Allies are not targeted by any minions you summon, unless you use the [[minion targeting|Minion-Targeting]] mechanic to target them manually
* Allies are not targeted by any creatures you mind control
* Lightning from your spells does not chain to allies
* Spells which seek targets do not seek your allies
* Allies are affected by group spells such as invigorating presence
* Allies will not trigger magical traps such as snare
* Allies are not damaged by spells that have an area of effect
* _However, spells aimed directly at allies will still affect them as normal_

If enabled, the friendly fire config option makes allies immune to all damage and negative effects from spells you cast. (Personally, I think this is unbalanced in regular survival, but it's there if you want it - it could also be useful for some sort of minigame...)

You can also interact with the ADS using the /ally and /allies commands; see [[Commands|Commands]] for details.

The ADS supports the scoreboard team system in vanilla minecraft - players on the same team are automatically allies of each other. This feature overrides the normal behaviour.
