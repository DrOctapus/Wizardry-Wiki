Poison bombs are throwable items that cause a small blast of poisonous gas on impact. They may be found in loot chests or crafted.

## Usage
Right-clicking whilst holding a poison bomb will throw it in the direction the player is looking, much like a snowball or ender pearl. When the poison bomb hits a block or creature, it will explode, dealing 2 hearts of damage to all mobs within 3 blocks and inflicting them with poison II for 5 seconds. If the poison bomb hits a creature directly, that creature will take an extra half-heart of damage.
