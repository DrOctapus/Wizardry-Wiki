Lightning wraiths are stormy counterparts to blazes, and are one of the magical creatures added by wizardry. They can be found guarding [[obelisks|obelisk]] and rarely spawn during thunderstorms. They can also be summoned by players and other spell casters using the [[summon lightning wraith]] spell.

## Spawning
The mob spawner in a lightning obelisk spawns lightning wraiths. They can also spawn naturally during thunderstorms (in any biome), though this is relatively rare. Lightning wraiths may also be summoned using the summon lightning wraith spell, which can be cast by players, [[wizards|wizard]], [[evil wizards|evil wizard]] and dispensers.

## Behaviour
Lightning wraiths behave similarly to blazes, but instead of fireballs, they shock their target, much like the [[arc]] spell. This deals the same damage as the arc spell, which is 1.5 hearts by default. Like blazes, lightning wraiths can fly and will not take fall damage, however, unlike blazes, they will not take damage when wet, and are immune to shock damage instead of fire.

Upon detecting a suitable target, a lightning wraith will fly into the air, and after a short while, rapidly shock the target three times (provided it is in range). The lightning wraith will then descend again and wait for a short cooldown period before repeating this attack sequence.

Summoned lightning wraiths will not attack their owners or allies of their owners unless attacked by them first. This can be disabled using the [[minion revenge targeting|Configuration#minion revenge targeting]] setting.
