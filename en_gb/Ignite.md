## Description
_Sets the target on fire for 10 seconds. Also works like a flint and steel._

Ignite is the most basic of all the fire spells, working essentially like a flint and steel, but with a longer range. It can be used to set fire to entities or place fire in the world. Ignite is the fire equivalent of the [[freeze]] spell.

## Trivia
- Ignite can be used for lighting nether portals - the cool way!
