Ice wraiths are icy counterparts to blazes, and are one of the magical creatures added by wizardry. They can be found guarding [[obelisks|obelisk]] and rarely spawn at night in some snowy biomes. They can also be summoned by players and other spell casters using the [[summon ice wraith]] spell.

## Spawning
The mob spawner in an ice obelisk spawns ice wraiths. They can also spawn naturally at night in certain snowy biomes (in vanilla: tundra, ice spikes, ice mountains, and their variants), though this is relatively rare. Ice wraiths may also be summoned using the summon ice wraith spell, which can be cast by players, [[wizards|wizard]], [[evil wizards|evil wizard]] and dispensers.

## Behaviour
Ice wraiths behave similarly to blazes, but instead of fireballs, they shoot [[ice shards|ice shard]]. These deal the same damage as the ice shard spell, which is 3 hearts by default. Like blazes, ice wraiths can fly and will not take fall damage, however, unlike blazes, they will not take damage when wet, and are immune to frost damage instead of fire.

Upon detecting a suitable target, an ice wraith will fly into the air, and after a short while, rapidly shoot 3 ice shards towards the target. The ice wraith will then descend again and wait for a short cooldown period before repeating this attack sequence.

Summoned ice wraiths will not attack their owners or allies of their owners unless attacked by them first. This can be disabled using the [[minion revenge targeting|Configuration#minion revenge targeting]] setting.
