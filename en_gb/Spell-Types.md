All [[spells]] have a spell type, which describes the general usage category of the spell. There are currently eight spell types: attack, defence, utility, minion, buff, construct, projectile and alteration. Spell types are currently purely informational.

### Attack
This spell type is for spells that deal damage directly to targets. They may be ray-type spells, continuous stream spells, or perhaps the summoning of inanimate entities such as lightning.

### Defence
This spell type is for spells that block damage or heal their caster.

### Utility
This spell type is for spells that perform some useful function for their caster, which is usually not combat-related.

### Minion
This spell type is for spells that summon sentient creatures to do their caster's bidding.

### Buff
This spell type is for spells that bestow beneficial effects on their caster, which may or may not be combat-related.

### Construct
This spell type is for spells that conjure magical constructs - inanimate entities which are usually quite large, remain in one place, and last for a set duration of time. Trap spells also fit into this category.

### Projectile
This spell type is for spells that conjure magical projectiles. These may or may not be affected by gravity, and have numerous different effects on impact.

### Alteration
This spell type is for spells that inflict negative effects on their target but do not damage their target directly.
