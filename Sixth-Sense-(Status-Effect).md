## Description
Sixth sense is a beneficial status effect which allows players to see the positions of living creatures through solid blocks. A player with under the effects of sixth sense I sees a lime green dot at the location of each living creature within 20 blocks, sixth sense II increases the range to 25 blocks, sixth sense III to 30 blocks, and so on. The screen also has a dark, bluish vignette effect over it while sixth sense is active.

## Sources
The sixth sense spell grants the caster sixth sense I for 20 seconds without modifiers. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- Sixth sense has no effect on creatures other than players.
