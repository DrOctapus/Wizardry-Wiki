_Electroblob's Wizardry_ has come a long way since its beginnings as a personal foray into Minecraft modding and its initial release in April 2017. Here's a little about how the mod came to be, and the people who made it happen.
从涉足制作到创作完整的Minecraft模组，再到2017年四月发布首个版本， _巫术学_ 模组正在不断发展。接下来的这段文字会告诉你这个模组诞生的历史，以及对这个模组的诞生有重要贡献的人。  

## About _Electroblob's Wizardry_  
##关于 _巫术学_   

A few years ago I got into playing with Minecraft mods, and having played around with some of the most popular magic mods, including Ars Magica 2, Equivalent Exchange and Thaumcraft, I felt that somehow they lacked something. Don't get me wrong, they're excellent mods and my coding skills aren't a patch on the likes of Azanor's, but ultimately I decided I wanted something a little different. In particular, I wanted a way to recreate the slick, combat-oriented magic from classic RPG games in Minecraft.   
几年前我开始游玩Minecraft模组，并且还体验了几个最受欢迎的魔法类模组，包括魔法艺术2、

After a little thought, I decided that what I wanted was a mod where I could cast combat-oriented spells, which most importantly I could progress through by exploring rather than sitting at home, and which gave me that sense of excitement of not quite knowing what I would find. And I quickly realised I would want a lot of spells to make that work.

No mod that existed at the time fitted the bill - and so _Electroblob's Wizardry_ was born.

I took inspiration for spells from various places, including:
- _The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim_. A lot of spells resemble the ones in Skyrim, for the simple reason that they're just so good! There's a reason Skyrim is so popular. However, I didn't want to make a 'Skyrim mod', as that would have tied me into only the content from Skyrim and limited the mod's originality.
- _Dungeons and Dragons_. Magic missile is an example of an idea from there.
- _Dark souls_. Shadow ward, lightning arrow, that sort of thing.
- Vanilla Minecraft itself! Some spells simply came from thinking of things that would fit nicely into the existing game, like vanishing box, pocket furnace and growth aura.

My main aims for the mod are as follows:
- Mana should be gained by doing what you'd do normally in vanilla Minecraft: mining, exploring and farming.
- Progression requires exploration.
- Keep blocks, items and crafting recipes to a minimum.
- Make the spells useful, playable and balanced. Not so useless that players instantly switch to a sword, but not so overpowered that they never use a sword again.
- Intuitive mechanics and a short set-up phase - a player should have access to novice spells at about the same stage as they get iron equipment.

The real moment of inspiration came when I realised the spell system I had created would be perfect for expanding upon, allowing any number of new spells to be added later on should users grow tired of the ones in the base mod. Several fans have taken it upon themselves to write spell packs and other addons using this system - you can find links to these on wizardry's CurseForge page.
