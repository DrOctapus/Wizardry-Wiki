奥术工作台是一个用来充能、升级、装备[[法术|Spells]]到 [[法杖|Wands]]上的方块。也可以充能、升级 [[巫师套装|Wizard-Armour]], 制作[[法术卷轴|Scrolls]]. 它的外观和附魔台差不多。奥术工作台是巫术mod的核心，也是大部分玩家游玩的开始。

## 外观
奥术工作台的外观和附魔台差不多，它们尺寸相同，在奥术工作台的四周镶嵌着宝石，中间铺着一块布。像附魔台一样，奥术工作台也会发光。它的外观还原了合成配方，底座是青金石块，有着紫色和黄色地毯在其上方，镶嵌着 [[魔法水晶|Magic-Crystal]] 在四个角落。当一个法杖、卷轴或者装备放置到奥术工作台时，它就会漂浮在奥术工作台上方。物品对准的方向会一直跟随玩家。会有黄色符文在其下方缓慢转动。 

## 获取
An arcane workbench can be obtained by crafting it from a block of lapis lazuli, 3 stone, 2 magic crystals, 2 gold nuggets and a piece of purple carpet. Arcane workbenches also generate in [[wizard towers|Wizard-Tower]], providing an alternative method of obtaining them. This, however, is not advised, since the [[wizard|Wizard]] in the tower will not take kindly to the player stealing their arcane workbench.

## Usage
Right-clicking on an arcane workbench opens a GUI which allows the player to access its various functions. In the centre of the GUI is a slot which accepts a wand, blank scroll or piece of wizard armour; this is the item that will be charged, upgraded or have spells bound to it. Upon placing an wand or blank scroll in the central slot, a number of other slots appear in a circle around it: 1 for a blank scroll and 5-8 for a wand (depending on the number of [[attunement upgrades|Special-Wand-Upgrades#attunement-upgrade]] applied to it).

Spell books may be placed in these slots to bind them to the wand or scroll. In addition, the two slots on the left-hand side of the GUI allow magic crystals (upper slot) and upgrades (lower slot) to be placed in the arcane workbench in order to charge or upgrade the item respectively. Pressing the 'Apply' button completes the charging, upgrading and/or binding of spells to the item. Any combination of these three operations may be carried out simultaneously.

Spell books are not consumed during spell binding, but magic crystals and upgrades are consumed during charging and upgrading. If the item is removed from the central slot while spell books remain in the slots around it, these slots will disappear as normal and the spell books will be returned to the player's inventory.

When a wand is placed in the central slot, a tooltip is shown to the right of the main GUI which displays the name of the wand, the mana currently stored within it, the spells that are currently bound to it and any upgrades that have been applied to it. Hovering over one of these upgrade icons displays the name of the upgrade.

## Trivia
- The rotation of the item floating above the arcane workbench is done client-side, so in multiplayer, each player looking at the workbench sees the item facing towards them, even if they are standing on opposite sides of the workbench.
- The arcane workbench has been re-textured twice since its original appearance: in wizardry 1.1 and again in wizardry 4.2
