The arcane workbench is a block used to charge, upgrade and bind [[spells|Spells]] to [[wands|Wands]], to charge and upgrade [[wizard armour|Wizard-Armour]], and to create [[spell scrolls|Scrolls]]. It is somewhat similar in appearance to an enchantment table. The arcane workbench is central to wizardry's gameplay and is one of the first things that players craft to get started with the mod.

## Appearance
The arcane workbench is similar in appearance to an enchantment table, being the same dimensions and having a similar arrangement of gemstones in the corners and a cloth over the middle. Like enchantment tables, the arcane workbench emits a moderate amount of light. Its appearance reflects its crafting recipe, with a base made of lapis lazuli, a purple and gold cloth on top and gemstones resembling [[magic crystals|Magic-Crystal]] in the corners. When a wand, scroll or piece of wizard armour is placed into the arcane workbench, that item appears on the block itself and levitates above its surface. The item always turns such that its bottom edge faces the player. A slowly rotating yellow rune also floats beneath the item.

## Obtaining
An arcane workbench can be obtained by crafting it from a block of lapis lazuli, 3 stone, 2 magic crystals, 2 gold nuggets and a piece of purple carpet (see [[Crafting Recipes|Crafting-Recipes]]). Arcane workbenches also generate in [[wizard towers|Wizard-Tower]], providing an alternative method of obtaining them. This, however, is not advised, since the [[wizard|Wizard]] in the tower will not take kindly to the player stealing their arcane workbench.

## Usage
Right-clicking on an arcane workbench opens a GUI which allows the player to access its various functions. In the centre of the GUI is a slot which accepts a wand, blank scroll or piece of wizard armour; this is the item that will be charged, upgraded or have spells bound to it. Upon placing an wand or blank scroll in the central slot, a number of other slots appear in a circle around it: 1 for a blank scroll and 5-8 for a wand (depending on the number of [[attunement upgrades|Special-Wand-Upgrades]] applied to it).

Spell books may be placed in these slots to bind them to the wand or scroll. In addition, the two slots on the left-hand side of the GUI allow magic crystals (upper slot) and upgrades (lower slot) to be placed in the arcane workbench in order to charge or upgrade the item respectively. Pressing the 'Apply' button completes the charging, upgrading and/or binding of spells to the item. Any combination of these three operations may be carried out simultaneously.

Spell books are not consumed during spell binding, but magic crystals and upgrades are consumed during charging and upgrading. If the item is removed from the central slot while spell books remain in the slots around it, these slots will disappear as normal and the spell books will be returned to the player's inventory.

When a wand is placed in the central slot, a tooltip is shown to the right of the main GUI which displays the name of the wand, the mana currently stored within it, the spells that are currently bound to it and any upgrades that have been applied to it. Hovering over one of these upgrade icons displays the name of the upgrade.

## Trivia
- The rotation of the item floating above the arcane workbench is done client-side, so in multiplayer, each player looking at the workbench sees the item facing towards them, even if they are standing on opposite sides of the workbench.
- The arcane workbench was re-textured in wizardry 1.1 to look more like the items from which it is crafted.
