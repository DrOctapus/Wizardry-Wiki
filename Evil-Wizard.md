Evil wizards are hostile mobs who can cast spells. They can be found in some [[wizard towers|Wizard-Tower]], which generate naturally throughout the world, and rarely spawn in dark areas. Evil wizards are an alternative source of [[spell books|Spell-Book]] and occasionally drop their wands or armour.

## Spawning
Evil wizards naturally spawn in wizard towers, which generate throughout the overworld (or whichever dimensions are specified in the config - see [[Configuration|Configuration]] for details). In addition to this, they also occasionally spawn in dark areas, with the same spawn frequency as witches. They can also be spawned using an evil wizard spawn egg, available in the creative mode inventory, or using the /summon command.

## Attributes and Equipment
Evil wizards have a 50% chance to spawn as specialists in one of the seven [[elements|Elements]] (about a 7% chance for each element), and a 50% chance of having no element. Wizards with an element wear the corresponding elemental armour and carry an elemental wand of that element, whereas wizards without an element wear regular wizard armour and carry a non-elemental wand. A wizard's element affects the types of spells they cast, though it does not currently give a potency bonus to their attacks. Wizards with an element also have special names such as 'Pyromancer' and 'Earth Mage'.

Evil wizards spawn with a random tier of wand, but it is always powerful enough for the spells they cast. All wizards spawn with [[magic missile|Magic-Missile]] and three other spells chosen at random, with a high weighting on their element if they have one. In addition, all wizards know [[heal|Heal]] and use it independently from the rest of their spells, except healers, who know [[greater heal|Greater-Heal]] instead. Evil wizards occasionally drop their wand or one of their armour items as a rare drop, with random durability. Wands dropped by evil wizards have no spells or upgrades bound to them. Evil wizards also spawn with one of six randomly chosen skins, which have different hair and eye colours.

## Behaviour
Evil wizards are hostile towards players and regular wizards and will attack them on sight using magic. They are passive towards mobs and animals. When in combat, wizards will select different spells at random to use against their opponent, incurring that spell's cooldown each time. These are usually attack spells, but can also be defensive or utility spells such as blink or forcefield. When on less than full health, wizards will heal themselves periodically. When severely injured, they will heal themselves more often.

## Trivia
- Evil wizards currently use the same sounds as witches, but at a lower pitch
- Not all spells can be cast by wizards; see [[Spells|Spells]] for more information
- Evil wizards will fight each other if they accidentally hurt one another
- Right-clicking an evil wizard with a spell book in creative mode will randomly change one of the wizard's spells for that spell - this was a debug feature, but it's fun to play around with so it was left in
