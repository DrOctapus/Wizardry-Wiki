_The crafting recipe for fire runestone pedestals - other elements require their respective elemental crystals_

## Appearance
Runestone pedestal blocks appear to be made of coloured stone with roughly chiselled edges. The four side faces have a T-shaped pattern, which glows in the dark - though the block itself does not emit any actual light. The colours of the stone and pattern reflect the runestone pedestal's element.

## Usage
Runestone pedestals have no uses in survival mode besides construction and decoration. However, using commands it is possible to place a runestone pedestal which will behave as if it were part of a naturally-generated shrine, allowing shrines to be built artificially.

## Technical
_For an explanation of shrine mechanics themselves, see [[Shrine#Mechanics]]_.

When generated as part of a shrine, a runestone pedestal has its `natural` property set to `true`. This makes it unbreakable in survival mode and gives it a tile entity, which controls the shrine's mechanics. When the shrine is conquered, the pedestal is immediately replaced with a `natural=false` variant, which is breakable and has no tile entity. Runestone placed using the item is always the `natural=false` variant. However, using the `/setblock` command, it is possible to place a pedestal with its `natural` property set to `true`, which will behave as if it was generated naturally.
