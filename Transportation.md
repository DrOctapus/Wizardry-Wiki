## Description
_Transports the caster to their remembered stone circle. To use this spell, make a circle of stones of transportation, then right click it with a wand._

Upon casting transportation, the player receives a nausea effect and a portal sound plays. After a short delay, the caster is teleported to the location of their remembered stone circle, provided it is in the same dimension, and the nausea wears off with a brief blindness effect. A stone circle is an arrangement of 8 [[stones of transportation|Stone-of-Transportation]] in a square (because as we all know, circles are squares in _Minecraft_). To remember the location of one, any of the stones may be right-clicked with a wand. Doing so overwrites any previously remembered stone circle location.
