所有的 [[法术]] 和 [[魔杖]] 都有其所对应的等级。等级是衡量力量强弱的标准 —— 魔杖和法术的等级越高，它们蕴含的力量也就越为强大。高等级的法杖和法术卷轴/法术书也更为难以获得。等级大致划分为：基础、学徒、进阶、大师。

## 基础
>基础等级的法杖是可以被制作出来的。它最大能容纳700点的法力值，也只能释放出基础等级的法术。基础等级的法术一般都十分简单，任何人都能释放出来，而且这通常不会消耗太多法力值。但是这并不是说等你拥有更高等级的法杖和法术时这些基础等级的法术就可以抛之不顾了，恰恰相反，由于它们的释放仅需极其低廉的魔力值，这使得某些新手法术仍然是你最有性价比的选择之一。

每一位巫师都总是从基础开始一点一点地掌握这些法术的。基础法术无处不在，几乎所有的巫师都了解并能熟练地释放出来，即便通常他们并不会去主动使用。对于一位普通人来说，只需要给他一根魔杖，再给他一点引导，那他就能轻松地掌握那些基础法术，成为一名新手巫师。基础法术数量较少 —— 因为这些都相对来说比较简单，而稍微复杂一点的魔法则从学徒等级开始。

## 学徒
>学徒等级的法杖比基础等级的法杖稍微高级了那么一点. They hold up to 1500 mana and can cast novice and apprentice spells. Apprentice spells are a little more impressive than novice spells but usually cost more.

~ _The Wizard's Handbook_

Apprentice spells are a step up from novice spells, both in power and complexity. Most of an adept wizard's staple spells will be apprentice level, as they provide a good balance between effectiveness, fairly low mana cost and short cooldown times. Apprentice spells are much more numerous than novice spells, and encompass a wide variety of utility, attacking and defensive abilities. A certain level of practice is required in order to use apprentice spells effectively, though they are fairly readily available if you know where to look.

## Advanced
>Advanced wands are quite rare and are much more powerful. They can cast all spells except master spells, and hold 2000 mana. Advanced spells can grant superhuman powers such as invisibility and wreak havoc on enemies.

~ _The Wizard's Handbook_

Advanced spells are where the really impressive magic begins. A wizard who knows advanced spells is not a challenge to be taken lightly, and will have spent years training their magical skills in order to cast them. Advanced spells are, in fact, the most numerous of all the spells, mainly due to their diversity. However, they are also considerably rarer than novice and apprentice spells, so expect to do a fair amount of exploration to find them.

## Master
>Master wands are the most powerful wands in existence. They hold up to 2500 mana, and can cast any spell. Master spell books are very rare and the spells can cause complete devastation not only to enemies but even the world itself. Use with caution.

~ _The Wizard's Handbook_

Only the most powerful wands are capable of channelling the power required to cast master spells. Master spells often require a significant fraction of a wand's mana in order to cast them, and can have cooldowns of 30 seconds or more. In return, however, a master wizard is able to cast the most powerful spells in existence. The combination of their immense power and incredible rarity makes many master spells the stuff of legend - master spell books are often priceless relics from the ancient past... or at least, _almost_ priceless. It is said that some wizards are prepared to offer their most powerful spells to those they trust, for a price befitting of their rarity.
