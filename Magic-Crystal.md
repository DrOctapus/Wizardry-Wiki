Magic crystals are the physical source of mana used to charge [[wands|Wands]] and [[wizard armour|Wizard-Armour]],  as well as being an ingredient in numerous [[crafting recipes|Crafting-Recipes]]. They are central to the wizardry's gameplay, and in fact the first step in wizardry is to gather magic crystals.

## Obtaining
Magic crystals drop from [[crystal ore|Crystal-Ore]] when mined, which is their primary source. They can also be crafted from [[crystal flowers|Crystal-Flower]], which can be found growing on grass at the surface of the overworld, and from [[crystal blocks|Crystal-Blocks]], which are their storage block counterpart. Magic crystals are also dropped by [[evil wizards|Evil-Wizard]] when killed, and can be obtained by trading any [[spell book|Spell-Book]] with a [[wizard|Wizard]]. Additionally, they can be found as loot in dungeon chests and some [[wizard towers|Wizard-Tower]].

## Usage
Magic crystals are used primarily to charge wands and wizard armour in the [[arcane workbench|Arcane-Workbench]] or via [[mana flasks|Mana-Flask]]. They are also used in most of wizardry's crafting recipes, including being crafted with a book to obtain _[[The Wizard's Handbook|The-Wizard's-Handbook]]_. All wizard trades (except exchanging a spell book for crystals) cost some number of magic crystals along with gold, emeralds or diamonds.
