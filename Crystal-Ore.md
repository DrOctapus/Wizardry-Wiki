Crystal ore is the primary source of magic crystals, which supply mana to [[wands]] and [[wizard armour]] and are central to wizardry's gameplay.

## Generation
Veins of crystal ore generate at a similar frequency to gold ore veins, at depths between y=5 and y=30. Crystal ore may be found in veins of up to 5 blocks, though it is more common to find veins of 2 or 3 blocks. By default, crystal ore generates only in the overworld, but other dimensions may be added (and the overworld removed, if desired) using the [[ore dimensions config option|Configuration#ore-dimensions]].

## Obtaining
Crystal ore blocks themselves may only be obtained in survival mode using a pickaxe enchanted with silk touch. They are also available in the wizardry tab of the creative mode inventory, and can be obtained using the /give command.

## Usage
Crystal ore has no use in block form other than for decorative and construction purposes. Crystal ore blocks may be smelted to produce a single magic crystal; however, this is inefficient since crystal ore blocks have a chance to drop more than one crystal when mined.
