Scrolls are single-use spellcasting items. They can sometimes be found in loot chests, and may also be created by binding a spell to a blank scroll in the [[arcane workbench]].

## Obtaining
Blank scrolls may be crafted from 1 paper and 1 string (there is a [[config option|Configuration#use-alternate-scroll-recipe]] to also require a magic crystal). A blank scroll may be placed in the arcane workbench, allowing a spell to be bound to it by placing a [[spell book]] in the workbench along with enough [[magic crystals|Magic-Crystal]] to cast the spell. When the 'apply' button is pressed, the crystals will be consumed and the blank scroll will become a spell scroll, which has an enchantment glow effect. Continuous spells cannot be bound to scrolls.

Spell scrolls can also be found in loot chests in dungeons and [[wizard towers|Wizard-Tower]].

## Usage
Pressing the use item button whilst holding a spell scroll will cast the spell that is bound to it, destroying the scroll in the process. If the player has not previously cast the spell, this will cause it to be discovered - this can be useful for identifying higher-tier spells if you do not yet have a wand powerful enough to cast them.

## Trivia
- Wizards do not sell spell scrolls, and mobs do not drop them - they may only be found in chests or created by the player.
