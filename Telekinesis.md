## Description
_Moves an item or other small object towards you, or right-clicks the block you are looking at. Can also be used to disarm players._

Telekinesis has several uses:
1. Aiming at a dropped item moves it towards the player. Usually this results in the player picking up the item.
1. Aiming at a block that has a right-click action performs that action on the block, as if it were right-clicked with an empty hand. For example, wooden doors and trapdoors will open, levers and buttons will be pressed, and inventories will be opened.
1. Aiming at a player causes the item that player is currently holding to fly out of their hand in a random direction.

## Trivia
- Some [[wizards|Wizard]] know telekinesis, but only use it to disarm players.
