Artefacts are special magical items found in shrines, which provide bonuses, effects and abilities to enhance the player's magic. There are three types of artefact: rings, which generally improve attack abilities, amulets, which improve defensive abilities, and charms, which generally improve utility spells. Artefacts were primarily designed for use with the _Baubles_ mod, but can be used without it.

## Obtaining
The only way to obtain artefacts in survival is from loot chests in [[shrines|Shrine]]. Each shrine is guaranteed to contain one random artefact, with higher-tier artefacts being rarer. There are three rarities of artefact: uncommon, rare and epic, and the rarity of a particular artefact is shown in the colour of its item name, as with rare items from vanilla _Minecraft_ (yellow for uncommon, light blue for rare and pink for epic). Epic artefacts also show the enchantment glint effect.

## Usage
If the _Baubles_ mod is installed, artefacts may be equipped by placing them in the appropriate bauble slot. Otherwise, an artefact is considered equipped when placed in a hotbar slot. Only the first two rings, and first one amulet or charm, can be active at any one time, with the leftmost hotbar slots taking priority.
