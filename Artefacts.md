Artefacts are special magical items found in shrines

## Obtaining
The only way to obtain artefacts in survival is from loot chests in [[shrines|Shrine]]. Each shrine is guaranteed to contain one random artefact, with higher-tier artefacts being rarer.

## Usage

If the _Baubles_ mod is installed, artefacts may be equipped by placing them in the appropriate bauble slot. Otherwise, an artefact is considered equipped when placed in a hotbar slot. Only the first two rings, and first one amulet or charm, can be active at any one time, with the leftmost hotbar slots taking priority.
