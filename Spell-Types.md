All [[spells]] have a spell type, which describes the general usage category of the spell. There are currently four spell types: attack, defence, utility and minion.

> In future, more spell types will be added to categorise spells more precisely, and a spell's type will affect how it is used by wizards and other non-player spell casters.

### Attack
This spell type is for spells that deal damage directly to targets or inflict some sort of negative effect upon them. They may be projectile spells, ray-type spells, or perhaps the summoning of inanimate entities such as lightning.

### Defence
This spell type is for spells that block damage or heal their caster.

### Utility
This spell type is for spells that perform some useful function for their caster, which is usually not combat-related.

### Minion
This spell type is for spells that summon sentient creatures to do their caster's bidding.
