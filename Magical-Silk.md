Magical silk is a crafting ingredient used to make [[wizard armour]].

## Obtaining
Magical silk can be crafted from four string and a [[magic crystal]] (see [[Crafting Recipes]] for details). It is also available in the creative mode inventory and via the /give command.

## Usage
The sole use of magical silk is to craft regular (non-elemental) wizard armour, in the same layout as vanilla armour recipes.
