符文石性质与石头相似，它有着7种元素变体，每种变体上都雕刻着不同的发光符文。它是一种建筑材料，是构成[[方碑|方碑]]和[[祭坛|祭坛]]的主要材料。

## Obtaining
Runestone can be crafted from 8 stone surrounding a magic crystal of the corresponding [[element|Elements]], or it can be collected from naturally-generated shrines and obelisks. It is also available in the wizardry tab of the creative mode inventory and via the /give command.

## Appearance

Runestone blocks appear to be made of coloured stone with roughly chiselled edges. One of the six sides of each runestone block bears a random rune, which glows in the dark - though the block itself does not emit any actual light. This uses the alternate blocks feature included in vanilla _Minecraft_'s model system, and as such, which rune shows and which direction it faces depend on where the block is placed. There are four different runes that can appear for each elemental variant. The colours of the stone and runes reflect the runestone's element.

## Usage
Runestone has no uses besides construction and decoration.
