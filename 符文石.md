Runestone is a block with similar properties to stone, which is available in 7 elemental varieties and bears an assortment of glowing runes. It serves as a decorative block and building material, and is the primary block from which [[obelisks|Obelisk]] and [[shrines|Shrine]] are constructed.

## Obtaining
Runestone can be crafted from 8 stone surrounding a magic crystal of the corresponding [[element|Elements]], or it can be collected from naturally-generated shrines and obelisks. It is also available in the wizardry tab of the creative mode inventory and via the /give command.

## Appearance

Runestone blocks appear to be made of coloured stone with roughly chiselled edges. One of the six sides of each runestone block bears a random rune, which glows in the dark - though the block itself does not emit any actual light. This uses the alternate blocks feature included in vanilla _Minecraft_'s model system, and as such, which rune shows and which direction it faces depend on where the block is placed. There are four different runes that can appear for each elemental variant. The colours of the stone and runes reflect the runestone's element.

## Usage
Runestone has no uses besides construction and decoration.
