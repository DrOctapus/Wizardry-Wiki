## Description
_Turns the target to stone until broken out, with a chance for it to break out when it is dark. The target cannot move or do anything while petrified but is also impervious to all damage._

Petrify shoots a ray of grey-green particles in front of the caster which instantly turns the creature it hits to stone. Petrified creatures exist as blocks in the world which have the appearance and properties of stone but the shape of the creature that was petrified, with any items it was carrying and armour it was wearing. As they are blocks, petrified creatures cannot move and are impervious to damage until broken out. Petrified creatures have a chance to break out randomly at light levels of 7 or less; this chance increases the lower the light level. Petrified creatures may also be broken out by using a pickaxe to break one of the blocks.

## Trivia
- Players are immune to petrification.
- Petrify was added early on in wizardry's development, but has been through several changes since then. In wizardry 1.1, the blocks were changed from simple stone cubes to the full entity model complete with items, and their behaviour was changed from always breaking at sunset to randomly breaking at low light levels.
- When in pitch darkness, petrified creatures will rarely stay petrified for longer than a minute. Conversely, at light levels above 7 petrified creatures will never break out naturally.
- Petrified creatures are tile entities, so it is not advisable to create large quantities of them!
