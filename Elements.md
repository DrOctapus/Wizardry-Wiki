All [[spells]] in wizardry have an element, as do many [[wizards|Wizard]], [[wands]] and sets of [[wizard armour]]. Elements are woven into every aspect of magic: they describe the nature of spells belonging to them, determine how magic interacts with different creatures and environments, and create synergy between certain spells, wands and armour. There is much to be gained from specialising into a single element, though this is by no means the only path a wizard can take.

## Magic
Magic is not really an element in the truest sense. It exists firstly because of non-elemental wizards, wands and wizard armour, and secondly as the element for the [[magic missile]] spell. Spells and items associated with the element of magic show no particular alignment to any of the other elements.

## Fire
>Perhaps the most destructive element, fire concerns burning, lava, and explosions. A powerful pyromancer will unleash hell upon their enemies and probably set the world alight in the process. Most fire attack spells set fire to their target, causing ongoing damage over time. However, be wary that fire spells may have no effect on nether mobs. - _The Wizard's Handbook_

## Ice
>The element of ice is made of all that is cold. Frost spells often slow enemies down or freeze them completely, and are especially effective on creatures of fire. Frost magic can prove equally useful outside of combat, such as freezing water to cross a river. - _The Wizard's Handbook_

## Lightning
>This element concerns lightning, storms, and the weather. A powerful storm mage is a force to be reckoned with, and some posess the ability to call down lightning at will. Lightning spells often damage multiple enemies at once and usually seek their target, making them an effective attack against any mob... but beware of creepers. - _The Wizard's Handbook_

## Necromancy
>Necromancy is the element of darkness, chaos and the undead. Necromancers are mysterious and often regarded as evil, though this is usually not the case. Necromancy spells are commonly used to summon creatures to fight for you or even bend the will of your enemies. - _The Wizard's Handbook_

## Earth
>The element of earth is focused on the natural world: animals, plants, the wind, and such like. Earth magic is diverse and takes a wide variety of forms, from poisoning enemies to unleashing the fury of the weather. Earth spells are a mixture of attack, defence and utility. - _The Wizard's Handbook_

## Sorcery
>Sorcery is the element of force and change. Sorcerers manipulate light, gravity and even reality itself to fit their needs. Sorcery spells can be used, among other things, to grant their caster magical powers or move objects to their will. - _The Wizard's Handbook_

## Healing
>The element of healing is concerned with defence and regeneration. Healers seek to protect themselves and their allies as much as possible and as such can be very difficult opponents. Though generally not used as an attack, the purifying light of some healing spells will do considerable damage to the undead. Healing spells are indispensable when in combat. - _The Wizard's Handbook_
