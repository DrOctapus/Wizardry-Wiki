~ _The Wizard's Handbook_

Wizard towers are structures which generate at the surface throughout the overworld, or whichever dimensions are specified by the [[tower dimensions config option|Configuration#tower-dimensions]]. Wizard towers are round in shape, with pointed roofs and small windows, and can be found in a variety of shapes and sizes. Wizard towers contain an [[arcane workbench|Arcane-Workbench]], a number of bookshelves, torches and a [[wizard|Wizard]]. Sometimes, they contain an [[evil wizard|Evil-Wizard]] and a chest with magical loot instead of a regular wizard.

## Generation
Wizard towers generate on the surface of the overworld, or whichever dimensions are specified in the config. Their default spawn frequency makes them fairly uncommon, about as common as abandoned mineshafts, though this can be changed in the config. Wizard towers generate in all biomes except those listed in the wizardTowerBiomeBlacklist config option. They also change their materials depending on the biome. Some of the blocks at the base of the tower may be mossy variants, with wetter biomes resulting in more moss. There are four different tower designs: short, medium, tall and branched, which can spawn facing all four directions and with mirrored variants. 

In most biomes, wizard towers have walls made out of cobblestone, but they can also be made of moss stone, sandstone, stone bricks or terracotta when generating in swampy/dense, desert, mountain or mesa biomes respectively. The roofs are made of a randomly selected colour of stained clay. Inside, the floors are made of wooden planks, which match the wood type in forested biomes. Wizard towers have 1x1 windows made of glass panes and a single oak door at the bottom.

## Interior
Wizard towers contain a spiral staircase of wooden slabs leading up to the upper floor, where there is an arcane workbench and a number of bookshelves. The walls of the tower are lit with torches. A single wizard can be found inside the tower, and there is a 25% chance that this wizard will be an evil wizard (this chance can be changed in the config). In towers with an evil wizard, one of the bookshelves is replaced by a chest containing magical loot.

## Trivia
- The Wizardry 4.2 update made numerous changes to wizard tower generation, most notably that it now uses the NBT structure file system used by vanilla _Minecraft_.
- Prior to Wizardry 4.2, in some extreme cases, wizard towers could generate on steep cliffs or on the edges of ravines, causing their foundations to extend far downwards and sometimes leaving their doors high above the ground - this effect also sometimes occurs in NPC villages
- Wizard towers have occasionally been seen to generate on top of huge mushrooms in roofed forests
