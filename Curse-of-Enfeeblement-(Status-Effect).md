## Description
Curse of enfeeblement is a curse which reduces its host's maximum health and, for players, prevents natural regeneration. Curse of enfeeblement I reduces a player or mob's maximum health by 20%, and each subsequent level reduces it by a further 20%.
> Curses a special kind of negative potion effect added by wizardry. They are permanent and can only be removed by casting [[remove curse]] or drinking a [[purifying elixir]]. They also have a special purple background on-screen and in the inventory.

## Sources
The curse of enfeeblement spell inflicts curse of enfeeblement I on its target for 15 seconds without modifiers. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- Amplifiers above curse of enfeeblement IV (obtainable only using commands) reduce the host's maximum health by 100% or more, effectively killing them instantly.
