Tomes of arcana are items used to upgrade a wand's [[tier|Tiers]]. They come in three types: apprentice, advanced and master, each being rarer than the last. Tomes of arcana are central to the progression system in wizardry as they are the main way of obtaining higher-tier [[wands]], and hence unlocking higher-tier [[spells]].

## Obtaining
Tomes of arcana can be found in loot chests in dungeons and wizard towers or purchased from [[wizards|Wizard]]. Apprentice tomes of arcana are fairly common, advanced tomes are more uncommon, and master tomes are quite rare. Tomes of arcana can also be obtained from the wizardry tab of the creative mode inventory and via the /give command.

_N.B. to specify a particular tome of arcana using the /give command, the metadata for the desired tier should be used: 1 for apprentice, 2 for advanced and 3 for master._

## Usage
The sole use of tomes of arcana is to upgrade wands in the [[arcane workbench|Arcane-Workbench]]. This is done by placing the wand in the central slot and the tome of arcana in the lower of the two slots on the left, and then pressing the 'apply' button. The wand will be transformed into a wand of the next tier, and will retain the same spells, mana and [[special upgrades|Special-Wand-Upgrades]] as before. The correct tome of arcana must be applied in order for the upgrade to work: apprentice tomes of arcana will upgrade novice wands to apprentice tier, advanced tomes will upgrade apprentice wands to advanced tier, and master tomes will upgrade advanced wands to master tier. This means that to upgrade a novice wand to master tier, all three tomes of arcana must be applied in order.
