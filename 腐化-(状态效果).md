## Description
Decay is a negative status effect which has several dangerous effects. Players or mobs under the effects of decay will take ongoing damage (similar to the wither effect), have reduced movement speed, and place patches of decay wherever they walk. Decay I reduces movement speed by 20%, and each subsequent level (though not naturally occurring) will reduce movement speed by a further 20%. 
腐化是一种负面的状态效果。受腐化效果玩家或生物会在一段时间内不断伤害（类似凋零效果），减少移动速度，并在走过的位置放置一个patches of decay。腐化 I 会使移动速度降低 20% ，每一个等级都会降低20%的移动速度（虽然这不能在正常情况下产生）。

## Sources
Any creature which steps on a patch of decay will be inflicted with the decay status effect for 20 seconds. The only other source of the effect is via commands. Decay patches themselves are placed by the decay spell and by other creatures with the decay effect. 
任何在patch of decay上经过的生物都会获得 20 秒的腐化效果。其次只有通过命令才能获得。腐化法术和受到腐化影响的生物会生成Decay atches。

## Trivia
- To avoid an infinite loop of self-infection, creatures are not inflicted with the decay effect when stepping on patches of decay they spread hemselves. 
- 为了避免腐化效果无限循环，生物不会受到自己产生的patches of decay的影响。
- Amplifiers higher than decay I can only be obtained using commands, and only change the amount of slowness applied; the damage rate remains the same. 
- 高等级的腐化效果只能通过命令获得，并且每个等级只会更改减少的速度，伤害不会增加。
