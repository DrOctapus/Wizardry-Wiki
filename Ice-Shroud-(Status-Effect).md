## Description
Ice shroud is a beneficial status effect which causes players and mobs to inflict [[frostbite]] on attackers. A player or mob with the ice shroud effect causes any creature that melee attacks it to be inflicted with frostbite I for 5 seconds.

## Sources
The ice shroud spell grants the caster ice shroud I for 30 seconds. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- The amplifier has no effect for ice shroud, much like fire resistance or water breathing in vanilla _Minecraft_.
