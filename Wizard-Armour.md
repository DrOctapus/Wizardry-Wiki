Wizard armour is a form of magical armour which uses mana to shield its wearer from incoming damage. Both regular and elemental wizard armour sets are available, though only the former can be crafted. Each set consists of a hat, robes, leggings and boots. Wizard armour may also be found in loot chests or purchased from [[wizards|Wizard]].

## Appearance
Wizard armour has a cloth-like appearance, with a base colour and a highlight colour which depend on the [[element|Elements]]. Wizard armour has a custom model: wizard hats are pointed with a wide brim and folded-over peak, wizard robes extend downwards over the player's legs, and wizard leggings and boots are similar in shape to the armour in vanilla _Minecraft_.

## Obtaining
Regular, non-elemental wizard armour may be obtained by crafting it from [[magical silk|Magical-Silk]]. All wizard armour may be obtained from loot chests, with an equal chance for items from each of the eight sets. Wizard armour of all types may also be purchased from [[wizards|Wizard]]. All wizards and [[evil wizards|Evil-Wizard]] wear wizard armour, and evil wizards will occasionally drop one or more of their armour pieces as a rare drop.

## Usage
When worn, wizard armour provides protection between that of chain armour and iron armour. Wizard armour consumes mana in the same way as other armour consumes durability - the amount of mana consumed depends on the amount of damage and type of incoming attacks. However, when wizard armour reaches zero mana, instead of breaking it becomes depleted, remaining in the armour slot but no longer providing any protection. Wizard armour may be recharged by placing it in the central slot of an [[arcane workbench|Arcane-Workbench]] and supplying it with [[magic crystals|Magic-Crystal]] in the same way as with a [[wand|Wands]].

Elemental wizard armour provides its wearer with a cost reduction for spells of the same element of 20% per armour piece.

Wizard armour may be upgraded using an [[arcane seal of protection|Arcane-Seal-of-Protection]], making it legendary. Legendary wizard armour has an alternate texture and provides protection equal to that of diamond armour (provided, of course, that it has mana).

Wizard armour may also be enchanted at an enchanting table. It has an enchantability of 15, equal to that of leather armour.

## Trivia
- Unlike most armour, wizard armour has a 64x64 texture
