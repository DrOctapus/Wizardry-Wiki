Wands are the implements used to cast spells. Each wand holds a certain number of spells and a certain quantity of mana, which depend on its tier and any [[special wand upgrades|Special-Wand-Upgrades]] that have been applied. The novice magic wand can be crafted, and higher-tier wands may be obtained by upgrading other wands using [[tomes of arcana|Tome-of-Arcana]]. Wands may also be found in loot chests or purchased from [[wizards|Wizard]].

## Obtaining
Novice magic wands (non-elemental) may be crafted from a stick, a gold nugget and a [[magic crystal|Magic-Crystal]]; see [[Crafting Recipes|Crafting-Recipes]]. Novice wands of all elements may be obtained from loot chests, with an equal chance for each element. Higher-tier wands can be obtained by upgrading lower-tier wands using [[tomes of arcana|Tome-of-Arcana]]. Wands of all types may also be purchased from [[wizards|Wizard]]. All wizards and [[evil wizards|Evil-Wizard]] carry a wand, and evil wizards will occasionally drop their wand as a rare drop.

## Usage
Right-clicking with a wand casts the currently equipped spell. Continuous spells require the right mouse button to be held in order to cast them; all other spells only require it to be pressed once. When the player is holding a wand, a heads-up display is shown in the corner of the screen, which shows the currently equipped spell: its name, icon and cooldown bar if it has recently been cast. The equipped spell can be selected using the N and B keys (these can be changed in options -> controls), or by scrolling with the mouse wheel whilst sneaking.

Spells are bound to wands using an [[arcane workbench|Arcane-Workbench]], which also allows them to be charged and upgraded. Tomes of arcana upgrade a wand to the next tier, whereas special wand upgrades improve a particular aspect of the wand or the spells it casts.

Wands may also be used to designate allies (see [[Ally Designation System|Ally-Designation-System]]), select minions' targets (see [[Minion Targeting|Minion-Targeting]]), dispel spirit animals, and remember locations for the [[transportation|Transportation]] and [[clairvoyance|Clairvoyance]] spells.
