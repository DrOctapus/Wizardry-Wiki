Firebombs are throwable items that cause a small blast of fire on impact. They may be found in loot chests or crafted.

## Obtaining
Firebombs may be found in loot chests in dungeons. They may also be crafted from a glass bottle, gunpowder and blaze powder.

_The crafting recipe for firebombs_

## Usage
Right-clicking whilst holding a firebomb will throw it in the direction the player is looking, much like a snowball or ender pearl. When the firebomb hits a block or creature, it will explode, dealing 2 hearts of damage to all mobs within 3 blocks and setting them on fire. If the firebomb hits a creature directly, that creature will take an extra half-heart of damage.
