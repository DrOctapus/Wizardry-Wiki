## Description
_Tear reality asunder._

Back hole is a master sorcery spell which conjures a churning vortex of darkness where the caster is aiming. The vortex will suck in any nearby mobs and players, and when they are near to its centre they will take ongoing damage. The vortex collapses after 30 seconds without duration modifiers. Black hole is most useful against groups of mobs, since it will deal the same amount of damage to each of its victims regardless of how many there are. The suction effect has a limited range, meaning that casting black hole in the wrong place can render it ineffective.

## Trivia
- Black hole is arguably the most powerful spell in the game, with the potential to deal huge amounts of damage if cast in the right place. However, this is offset by its very high mana cost and long cooldown.
- It is possible to escape a black hole by teleporting, or by sprint-flying. This means it is ineffective against endermen and [[wizards|Wizard]] or players with the [[blink]] spell.
