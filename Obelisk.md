Obelisks are structures which generate at the surface throughout the overworld, or whichever dimensions are specified by the [[obelisk dimensions config option|Configuration#obelisk-dimensions]]. Obelisks are tall and narrow, with an open structure at the bottom containing a monster spawner directly on top of a chest containing minor magical loot.

## Generation
Obelisks generate on the surface of the overworld, or whichever dimensions are specified in the config. Their default spawn frequency makes them fairly uncommon, about as common as abandoned mineshafts, though this can be changed in the config. Obelisks generate in all biomes. With the exception of the mob spawner and chest, obelisks are built exclusively of [[runestone]]. There are five different obelisk designs, which differ from each other in size and shape - however, all contain the same mob spawner and loot chest arrangement in the centre.

Each obelisk is aligned to one of the seven arcane [[elements]], which can easily be seen from the colour of the runestone from which it is built. This element also determines the type of mob that is spawned:

| Element | Mob Type |
| --- | --- |
| Fire | Blaze Minion |
| Ice | Ice Wraith |
| Lightning | Lightning Wraith |
| Necromancy | Wither Skeleton Minion |
| Earth | Spider Minion |
| Sorcery | Vex Minion |
| Healing | Husk Minion |

Obelisks cannot be aligned to the magic 'element'.

The loot chest found in an obelisk contains a variety of minor magical items, including magic crystals and elemental crystals, spell books and scrolls, and wand upgrades, as well as other loot such as books, paper and gold nuggets.

## Trivia
- When fast worldgen is enabled, obelisks can sometimes generate in lakes, resulting in them being partially or even fully submerged.
