Crystal flowers are small, glowing flowers that generate on grass throughout the surface of the overworld. They are a source of [[magic crystals|Magic-Crystal]] which is particularly useful early in the game.

## Appearance
Crystal flowers are similar in size to most single-block flowers in vanilla _Minecraft_. They have a green stem, on top of which sit three coloured petals which appear to have a crystalline shape. Crystal flowers produce randomly coloured sparkle particles which float slowly upwards. They also emit a dim glow at night.

## Obtaining
Crystal flowers can be found growing in small clusters on grass fairly commonly throughout the overworld (or the dimensions specified by the [[flower dimensions config option|Configuration#flower-dimensions]]). They are perhaps easiest to find at night and in forested biomes, since their glow makes them easy to spot in dark areas.

## Usage
Currently, the only use for crystal flowers besides decoration is crafting them into magic crystals. Each crystal flower yields two magic crystals when placed in a crafting grid.
