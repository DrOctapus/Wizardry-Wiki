本词条是一个速成指南，可以帮助刚刚接触巫术学mod的玩家了解这个mod。如果你第一次接触巫术学，那这就是你成为大巫师的起点！


## 起始
当你进入游戏的第一件事就是收集魔法水晶，这些精巧的小物件是巫术学mod的核心一一它们为你的法杖提供魔力，各个配方中也会出现它的身影。一开始，你最起码要准备好15个魔法水晶，你可以在地底挖掘水晶矿来获得它们，不过在早期有一个更加快捷的方法——你以为我会在这告诉你？自己乖乖地去游戏里找吧！（你也可以去WIKI查阅，尽管这很考验你的耐心）
译者注：其实很简单，一进游戏你就知道啦：P


除此之外，你还需要收集一些石头、一把青金石、一些羊毛、少量金子与一些书。

## 制作
万事俱备，你就可以用一本书和一颗魔法水晶来合成一本
 _[[巫术手册|The-Wizard's-Handbook]]_了。这个方便的指南会告诉你一个成功的巫师该做的一切，包括你有可能用到的所有配方。打开手册，了解  [[法杖|Wands]]、 [[奥术工作台|Arcane-Workbench]] 、 [[魔法飞弹|Magic-Missile]] [[魔法书|Spell-Book]]的合成配方。

## The Arcane Workbench
Take your new arcane workbench and place it down somewhere (it doesn't matter where you put it for now, you can always pick it back up again with a stone pickaxe or better). Now right-click on it and you should see a GUI appear which looks something like this:

The central slot is where you can place wands, wizard armour and scrolls. Place your new magic wand in there - you should see five more slots appear in a circle around the central slot. These slots are for spell books, and each one corresponds to one of the spell slots on your wand. Unless you were lucky enough to find a spell book on your travels, you'll only have one - the magic missile spell book you crafted earlier - so place it in one of the five spell book slots.

The other thing you probably noticed when you placed your wand in the arcane workbench was the tooltip that appears to the right. If you take a look at that, you'll see that your wand currently holds no mana. **Mana** is the magical energy used to cast spells, and without it your wand isn't much use, so let's fix that! Take some magic crystals and place them in the slot in the bottom-left corner. Now click the big shiny confirm button (bottom-right), and the crystals should vanish! Don't worry though, they've been turned into mana, which is now stored within your wand.

You'll notice that the tooltip has changed in two ways: firstly, your wand will now have some mana - 100 times the number of crystals that were used up, to be exact - and secondly, there should now be a list of five spells that are bound to your wand. One of these will be magic missile, but the rest will probably say '[Empty slot]'. You can fill those up later once you get some more spells, but for now you're done with the arcane workbench, so take your wand and let's cast some spells!

## Casting Spells
Now you're all set to do some spellcasting! When you have a wand in your hand, you'll see a heads-up display appear in the corner of your screen (you can change its position using the config menu). This shows your currently equipped spell. Switch spells either by using the N and B keys (these can be changed in options -> controls), or by scrolling with the mouse wheel whilst sneaking. Right-click to cast the currently equipped spell.

## Next Steps
Congratulations, you've successfully begun your journey towards mastering the arcane! Wizardry, like _Minecraft_, is very open-ended - you can do whatever you want with your newfound magical powers. One thing you might want to do is to craft yourself a set of [[wizard armour|Wizard-Armour]] - besides providing essential protection, it'll also make you really look the part.

I also suggest going exploring: a world of wizards, magical artefacts, and of course spells, is out there to be discovered! Perhaps you want to conquer the deepest dungeons, wand in hand? Perhaps you want to seek knowledge from fellow wizards? Or maybe you want a magical library of every known spell? Better get collecting, there are no less than 172 of them!

So what are you waiting for? A world of arcane wonders awaits!
