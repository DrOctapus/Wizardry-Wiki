## Description
Mind control is a negative status effect which causes mobs to attack other hostile mobs. A mob with the mind control effect will target other mobs, wizards or players that are not allies of the player that controlled it. The controlling player is stored by UUID in the mob's NBT data (under the tag "controllingEntity").

## Sources
The mind control spell inflicts mind control I on its target for 30 seconds without modifiers. The only other source of the effect is via commands.

## Trivia
- The amplifier has no effect for mind control, much like blindness or nausea in vanilla _Minecraft_.
- Mind control has no effect on players or passive animals.
- Although mind control was one of the original spells in wizardry 1.0, the mind control status effect was only added in wizardry 1.1 as part of a change to how the spell worked.
